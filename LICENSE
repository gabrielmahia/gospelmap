FOREVER COMMUNITY-OWNED
=======================

Critical Commitment:

1. NO VATICAN CLOSURE: No organization (including the Vatican)
   can close or prevent access to this platform.

2. FORKABILITY: Any community can fork GospelMap and run
   independently if needed.

3. DATA RIGHTS: Community data belongs to communities,
   not to GospelMap maintainers.

4. TERMINATION CLAUSE: If GospelMap becomes abandoned,
   the code automatically transfers full rights to the
   community stewardship committee.
