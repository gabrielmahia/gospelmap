# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability in GospelMap:

**DO NOT open a public issue.**

Email directly to:
```
gabriel@aikungfu.dev
```

Include:
- Description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce
- Potential impact
- Suggested fix (if you have one)

We will acknowledge receipt within 48 hours and work toward a fix.

## Security Principles

1. **Data Privacy**: Community data is encrypted and community-owned
2. **No Corporate Extraction**: We don't sell or use data for profit
3. **Transparency**: Security practices are open for audit
4. **Community-First**: Security decisions prioritize community, not organization

## Bug Bounty

This is volunteer-maintained software. We don't have traditional bug bounties, but
we recognize and credit all security researchers who help improve GospelMap.
