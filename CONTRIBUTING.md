## Community Standards

1. **Humility**: We're learning together
2. **Respect**: All are welcome (LGBTQ+, divorced, poor, migrants)
3. **Accountability**: We're building systems that hold leadership accountable; we hold ourselves to the same standard
4. **Justice-First**: Every feature should serve the poor first
5. **Theology-Grounded**: Decisions rooted in Vatican II + Gospel

## Review Process

All PRs reviewed by:
- Theology committee (is it Gospel-grounded?)
- Engineering team (is it technically sound?)
- Community team (does it serve all?)
